    -Each route point has: latitude, longitude, boolean indicating whether a stop or not, and then all routes that use that point
    -Latitude, longitude, boolean, and each individual route that uses the point are all separate items

    -NOTE: These should be retrieved as a string. Then, parse the string to get each individual value
